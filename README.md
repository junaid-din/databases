## Creation of Bookshelfia Database and development of SQL queries

Created by [Junaid Din](https://github.com/junaid-din)

This project analyzing, designing, and implementing a relational database system for Bookshelfia, an online bookstore that sells books, magazines, and audiobooks. The goal was to support inventory management, order processing, and customer transactions. I acted in the role of a database designer, and developer, applying best practices in relational database design, normalising the database to 3rd Normal Form (3NF). The normalisation steps of the data are shown in a separate Excel workbook called 'Normalisation steps'. I also developed SQL scripts to query the database. The project culminated in a fully functional database prototype, including a Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), populated tables, and a suite of analytical SQL queries.

Tasks completed:

* Created an artificial dataset using the Faker Python Package
* Designed a relational database schema that covers products, customers, orders, payments, and inventory.
* Created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize relationships using primary and foreign keys.
* Ensured normalization to Third Normal Form (3NF) to eliminate redundancy and maintain data integrity.
* Created database tables and populated them with sample data.
* Developed SQL queries to answer key business questions:
